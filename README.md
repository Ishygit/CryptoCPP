# CryptoCPP
This is a CryptoApp C++ version.

To ensure it runs, we'll make sure you have a good file structure as it is important in C++.
Below is a structure you can adopt:
CryptoApp/
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── Encoder.h
│   ├── RotEncoder.h
│   ├── RotEncoder.cpp
│   ├── SbsEncoder.h
│   └── SbsEncoder.cpp
├── build/                <-- Compiled binary will be here
├── .vscode/
      |--tasks.json
      └── launch.json

Feel free to spot bugs and help fixing
Happy coding
